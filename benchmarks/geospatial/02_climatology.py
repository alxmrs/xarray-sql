"""Diurnal climatology — the "rechunk + grouped reduction" that is a GROUP BY.

A *climatology* is the average value for each time-of-cycle, computed
independently at every location: "what is the typical temperature here at
06:00?" In the array paradigm (and in the coiled/benchmarks #1545 write-up)
this is the canonical painful workload — load native Zarr chunks, *rechunk* to
put all of time in one chunk ("pencils"), run a grouped reduction over the
calendar, then rechunk back to "pancakes" for output.

The rechunking exists only to serve the array layout. The *operation* is::

    SELECT latitude, longitude, hour_of_day, AVG("2m_temperature")
    GROUP BY latitude, longitude, hour_of_day

Group by location and time-of-cycle, average the rest — the same answer as
``da.groupby("time.hour").mean()``. ERA5 is hourly, so grouping by hour of day
gives a clean 24-bin **diurnal cycle**, one sample per day in the window.

The table is the *whole* ARCO-ERA5 archive, opened lazily: the query reads only
``2m_temperature``, and only over the window its ``WHERE`` asks for — the rest of
the archive is never touched.
