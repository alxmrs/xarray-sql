"""Forecast skill — scoring ML weather models against ERA5 is a JOIN + aggregate.

Scoring the **Pangu-Weather** and **GraphCast** machine-learning forecast models
against ERA5 ground truth is the headline workload of
[WeatherBench 2](https://weatherbench2.readthedocs.io/). A forecast is indexed by
*initialization time* and *lead time* (``prediction_timedelta``); the truth is
indexed by *valid time*. Evaluation aligns them by ``valid_time = init + lead``
and reduces the error to RMSE as a function of lead — the classic "error grows
with forecast horizon" curve.

That alignment is a relational **JOIN**, and ``valid_time = init + lead`` is just
timestamp + duration arithmetic the engine does natively::

    SELECT f.model, f.prediction_timedelta AS lead,
           SQRT(AVG(POWER(f.t - e.t, 2))) AS rmse
    FROM forecasts f
    JOIN era5 e
      ON  e.time = f.time + f.prediction_timedelta   -- valid_time = init + lead
      AND e.latitude  = f.latitude
      AND e.longitude = f.longitude
    GROUP BY f.model, f.prediction_timedelta

We stack the two models along a ``model`` dimension into a single forecast
table, so one query scores them together, grouped by the ``model`` column. The
forecasts and ERA5 are opened lazily, and the JOIN reads only what it needs.

Datasets: WeatherBench 2 **Pangu**, **GraphCast**, and **ERA5** at a coarse
64×32 grid (so the demo is small and fast), read from the public ``gs://
weatherbench2`` bucket. Requires network; skips cleanly offline.
