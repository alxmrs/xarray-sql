"""NDVI — "apply_ufunc over a raster" is just column arithmetic.

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is the workhorse of optical remote
sensing: ``NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)``, computed per pixel. The array
paradigm reaches for ``xarray.apply_ufunc`` (the coiled/benchmarks #1545
"vectorized operations" case) to broadcast this over a whole scene.

But a per-pixel formula over two bands is just *column arithmetic over two
columns*::

    SELECT x, y, (nir - red) / (nir + red) AS ndvi
    FROM scene
    ORDER BY y, x

Each pixel is one row; the ufunc is the SELECT expression. Invalid pixels are
already NaN (xarray decodes the band's ``_FillValue`` on open), and NaN
propagates through the arithmetic on both sides — so the masking is free, no
``CASE`` required.

Dataset: a real Sentinel-2 L2A scene in **Zarr** from the ESA EOPF sample
service, discovered with ``pystac-client`` and opened the canonical way with
``xarray`` — ``xr.open_datatree`` yields the reflectance bands (B04=red,
B08=NIR at 10 m) already scaled to reflectance and carrying their ``x``/``y``
coordinates. We read one window so the case stays bounded. Requires network;
skips cleanly if the service is offline.
