"""Temperature anomaly — "broadcast-subtract the climatology" is a self-JOIN.

An *anomaly* is the departure of each observation from its climatological
normal: ``anomaly(t) = T(t) − climatology(hour-of-day(t))`` at each cell. The
array paradigm computes the climatology, then leans on xarray's grouped
broadcasting to line it back up with every timestep:
``ds.groupby("time.hour") - climatology``.

That broadcast — "attach each cell's normal back onto every matching timestep" —
is exactly a relational **JOIN** on the grouping key. So the anomaly is a
climatology CTE joined back to the raw observations::

    WITH clim AS (SELECT latitude, longitude, hour, AVG(T) ... GROUP BY ...)
    SELECT a.T - c.clim_t AS anomaly
    FROM era5 a JOIN clim c
      ON (a.latitude, a.longitude, hour(a.time)) = (c.latitude, c.longitude, c.hour)

We register the full ARCO-ERA5 archive as a lazy table, but the anomaly here is
computed over a *bounded window* (a few summer days over a CONUS-ish box): both
the climatology CTE and the outer scan read only ``2m_temperature``, and only
over the window the ``WHERE`` asks for — never the rest of the archive. You can
aim a query at the whole archive and pay only for the slice it asks for.
