```shell
pip install xarray-sql
```

## What is this?

This is an experiment to provide a SQL interface for array datasets.
Succinctly, we "pivot" Xarray Datasets to treat them like tables so we can run
SQL queries against them.

## Quickstart

Open a Dataset, register it as a table with `from_dataset`, compute a
climatology in SQL, then write the result back to Xarray and plot it:

> **Note:** this example also needs `pooch` and a netCDF backend (for the
> tutorial download) and `matplotlib` (for the plot):
> `pip install pooch netCDF4 matplotlib`.

```python
import xarray as xr
import xarray_sql as xql

# 4x-daily surface air temperature on a lat/lon grid, 2013-2014.
ds = xr.tutorial.open_dataset('air_temperature')

ctx = xql.XarrayContext()
ctx.from_dataset('air', ds, chunks=dict(time=100))

# A climatology — the mean annual cycle — computed in SQL: average air
# temperature for each month of the year, over all grid cells and years.
clim = ctx.sql('''
  SELECT
    CAST(date_part('month', "time") AS INTEGER) AS month,
    AVG("air") AS air
  FROM "air"
  GROUP BY CAST(date_part('month', "time") AS INTEGER)
  ORDER BY month
''')

# Write the SQL result back to an Xarray Dataset. `month` is a derived
# column, so name it as the dimension; the variable's units are recovered
# from the registered table. The result is one value per month: air(month).
clim_ds = clim.to_dataset(dims=["month"])

# Plot the annual cycle as a time series.
clim_ds["air"].plot()  # in a script, call matplotlib.pyplot.show() to display
```

That's the round trip — Xarray in, SQL in the middle, Xarray (and a plot) back
out.

## A bigger example: ARCO-ERA5

The same interface scales to cloud-native datasets with hundreds of variables,
like [ARCO-ERA5](https://github.com/google-research/arco-era5).

> **Note:** reading from `gs://` requires `gcsfs` (`pip install gcsfs`).

```python
import xarray as xr
import xarray_sql as xql


# Open ARCO-ERA5 — a weather dataset with 273 variables since 1940. 
# Turning off dask means we don't have to wait to construct a task graph.
ds = xr.open_zarr(
  'gs://gcp-public-data-arco-era5/ar/full_37-1h-0p25deg-chunk-1.zarr-v3',
  chunks=None,  # Turn dask off
  storage_options={'token': 'anon'}  # Anonymous read from the public GCS bucket — no auth required.
)

ctx = xql.XarrayContext()
# Make sure to pass `chunks`!
ctx.from_dataset('era5', ds, chunks=dict(time=6), table_names={
    ('time', 'latitude', 'longitude'): 'surface',
    ('time', 'level', 'latitude', 'longitude'): 'atmosphere',
})
# Registration takes ~10s on my machine.

# Heads up: ARCO-ERA5 has 262 surface + 11 atmospheric variables. The library
# pushes column projection down to Zarr, so SELECT only fetches what you ask
# for — but `SELECT * FROM era5.surface` would try to pull every variable
# across the year (terabytes from GCS). 
#  ---> Always SELECT specific columns. <---

# Average 2m-temperature over NYC on the morning of 2020-01-01. The library
# pushes WHERE clauses on dimension columns down to partition pruning.
ctx.sql('''
  SELECT AVG("2m_temperature") - 273.15 AS avg_c
  FROM era5.surface
  WHERE time BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2020-01-01'
                 AND TIMESTAMP '2020-01-01 05:00:00'
    AND latitude  BETWEEN 39 AND 40

#       avg_c

# Average temperature per pressure level, globally. 
result = ctx.sql('''
  SELECT level, AVG(temperature) - 273.15 AS avg_c
  FROM era5.atmosphere
  WHERE time BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2020-01-01'
                 AND TIMESTAMP '2020-01-01 05:00:00'

## Why build this?

A few reasons:

* Even though SQL is the lingua franca of data, scientific datasets are often
  inaccessible to non-scientists (SQL users).
* Joining tabular data with raster data is common yet difficult. It could be
  easy.
* There are many cloud-native, Xarray-openable datasets,
  from [Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/google/Xee)
  to the [Source Cooperative](https://source.coop/products?tags=zarr). Wouldn’t it be great if these
  were also SQL-accessible? How can the bridge be built with minimal effort?

This is a light-weight way to prove the value of the interface.

The larger goal is to explore the hypothesis that the [Pangeo
ecosystem is a scientific database](https://www.hytradboi.com/2025/c18b8cdc-fd17-4099-9c03-eb107217f627-pangeo-is-a-database). Here, xarray-sql can be thought of as a missing
DB front end.

## How does it work?

All chunks in a Xarray Dataset are transformed into a Dask DataFrame via
`from_map()` and `to_dataframe()`. For SQL support, we just use `dask-sql`.
That's it!

_2025 update_: This library now implements a Dask-like `from_map` interface in
pure DataFusion and PyArrow, but works with the same principle!

_2026 update_: Instead of `from_map()`, we create a way to translate Xarray chunks
into Arrow RecordBatches. We pass a Python callback into a DataFusion `TableProvider`
that lets the DB engine translate the underlying Dataset arrays into DataFusion partitions.
Ultimately, the initial insight of the `pivot()` function -- that any ndarray can be
translated into a 2D table -- underlies this performant query mechanism. 

## Does it work?

Yes. The recurring worry is that the SQL interface is a toy — fine for `SELECT`s,
but not for the operations geoscience actually runs. So we wrote a suite that
takes the staples of geospatial and climate analysis — the ones we assume *need*
an array library — and expresses each one in SQL, then **checks the SQL answer
against an xarray/array reference** to floating-point tolerance:

* **Spectral indices** (NDVI) — column arithmetic over a real Sentinel-2 scene.
* **Climatology, anomalies, zonal means** — `GROUP BY` and self-`JOIN` against
  the 0.25° **ARCO-ERA5** archive registered as a lazy table. Each query is
  bounded to a small window (a few days over a region) and reads only that
  slice — the point is that you can aim a query at a multi-decade archive and
  pay only for the data it asks for, not that the query scans the whole record.
* **Forecast skill** — scoring the **Pangu-Weather** and **GraphCast** ML models
  against ERA5 (WeatherBench 2) as a `JOIN` on `valid_time = init + lead`; it
  reproduces the published result that GraphCast beats Pangu at every lead.
* **Raster × vector zonal stats** — a range `JOIN` of the ERA5 grid against a
  table of regions.
* **Reprojection and regridding** — a scalar PROJ UDF (validated against Earth
  Engine's own geodesy via [Xee](https://github.com/google/Xee)) and a
  sparse-weight-table `JOIN` (regridding real SRTM terrain).

Every case matches its array reference. The headline finding: these operations
are not really "array" operations at all — they are `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, window
functions, and `CASE` in disguise, and a query engine runs them at scale. See
[`benchmarks/geospatial/`](benchmarks/geospatial/) and the write-up,
[Geospatial operations are relational operations](docs/geospatial.md).

## Why does this work?

Underneath Xarray, Dask, and Pandas, there are NumPy arrays. These are paged in
chunks and represented contiguously in memory. It is only a matter of metadata
that breaks them up into ndarrays. `pivot()`, which uses `to_dataframe()`,
just changes this metadata (via a `ravel()`/`reshape()`), back into a column
amenable to a DataFrame. We take advantage of this light weight metadata change to
make chunked information scannable by a DB engine (DataFusion).

## What are the current limitations?

TBD, DataFusion provides a whole new world! Currently, we're looking for
early users – "tire kickers", if you will. We'd love your input to shape the direction of this
project! Please, give this a try and [file issues](https://github.com/alxmrs/xarray-sql/issues) as
you see fit. Check out our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md), too 😉.

## What would a deeper integration look like?

I have a few ideas so far. One approach involves applying operations directly on
Xarray Datasets. This approach is being pursued
[here](https://github.com/google/weather-tools/tree/main/xql), as `xql`.

Deeper still: I was thinking we could make
a [virtual](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/)
filesystem for parquet that would internally map to Zarr. Raster-backed virtual
parquet would open up integrations to numerous tools like dask, pyarrow, duckdb,
and BigQuery. More thoughts on this
in [#4](https://github.com/alxmrs/xarray-sql/issues/4).

_2025 update_: Something like this is being built across a few projects! The ones I know about are:

- [CartoDB's Raquet](https://github.com/CartoDB/raquet)
- The DataFusion community's [arrow-zarr](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/arrow-zarr)

_2026 update_: A colleague and I are experimenting with native Zarr RDBMS engines. Check out:

- [Zarr-Datafusion](https://lib.rs/crates/zarr-datafusion)
- [DuckDB-Zarr](https://github.com/alxmrs/duckdb-zarr)
