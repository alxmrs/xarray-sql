```shell
pip install xarray-sql
```

## What is this?

This is an experiment to provide a SQL interface for array datasets.

```python
import xarray as xr
import xarray_sql as xql

ds = xr.tutorial.open_dataset('air_temperature')

# The same as a dask-sql Context; i.e. an Apache DataFusion Context.
ctx = xql.XarrayContext()
ctx.from_dataset('air', ds, chunks=dict(time=24))  # the dataset needs to be chunked!
# DataFrame()

Succinctly, we "pivot" Xarray Datasets (with consistent dimensions) to treat them like tables so we can run
SQL queries against them.

## Why build this?

A few reasons:

* Even though SQL is the lingua franca of data, scientific datasets are often
  inaccessible to non-scientists (SQL users).
* Joining tabular data with raster data is common yet difficult. It could be
  easy.
* There are many cloud-native, Xarray-openable datasets,
  from [Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/google/Xee)
  to [Pangeo Forge](https://pangeo-forge.org/). Wouldnâ€™t it be great if these
  were also SQL-accessible? How can the bridge be built with minimal effort?

This is a light-weight way to prove the value of the interface.

The larger goal is to explore the hypothesis that the [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/)
ecosystem is a scientific database. Here, xarray-sql can be thought of as a missing
DB front end.

## How does it work?

All chunks in a Xarray Dataset are transformed into a Dask DataFrame via
`from_map()` and `to_dataframe()`. For SQL support, we just use `dask-sql`.
That's it!

_2025 update_: This library now implements a Dask-like `from_map` interface in 
pure DataFusion and PyArrow, but works with the same principle!

## Why does this work?

Underneath Xarray, Dask, and Pandas, there are NumPy arrays. These are paged in
chunks and represented contiguously in memory. It is only a matter of metadata
that breaks them up into ndarrays. `to_dataframe()`
just changes this metadata (via a `ravel()`/`reshape()`), back into a column
amenable to a DataFrame. We take advantage of this light weight metadata change to 
make chunked information scannable by a DB engine (DataFusion).

## What are the current limitations?

_2025 update_: TBD, DataFusion provides a whole new world! Currently, we're looking for
early users â€“ "tire kickers", if you will. We'd love your input to shape the direction of this 
project! Please, give this a try and [file issues](https://github.com/alxmrs/xarray-sql/issues) as
you see fit. Check out our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md), too ðŸ˜‰.

## What would a deeper integration look like?

I have a few ideas so far. One approach involves applying operations directly on
Xarray Datasets. This approach is being pursued
[here](https://github.com/google/weather-tools/tree/main/xql), as `xql`.

Deeper still: I was thinking we could make
a [virtual](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/)
filesystem for parquet that would internally map to Zarr. Raster-backed virtual
parquet would open up integrations to numerous tools like dask, pyarrow, duckdb,
and BigQuery. More thoughts on this
in [#4](https://github.com/alxmrs/xarray-sql/issues/4).

_2025 update_: Something like this is being built across a few projects! The ones I know about are:
- [CartoDB's Raquet](https://github.com/CartoDB/raquet)
- The DataFusion community's [arrow-zarr](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/arrow-zarr)

As of writing, this project is [amid integrating](https://github.com/alxmrs/xarray-sql/pull/69) a
rust-based DataFusion backend provided by arrow-zarr.
