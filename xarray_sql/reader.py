    This is the simplest way to register xarray data with DataFusion.
    Data is only read when queries are executed, not during registration.
    The table can be queried multiple times.

    Native chunks are coalesced into at most ``target_partitions`` scan
    partitions, so registration cost stays bounded at O(target_partitions)
    rather than O(num_native_chunks), even for stores with millions of fine
    chunks. Each partition still streams one native chunk at a time, so peak
    memory per partition is unchanged. This enables DataFusion's parallel
    execution while keeping registration tractable.

    Note:
        SQL queries with WHERE clauses on dimension columns (time, lat, lon, etc.)
        automatically prune partitions that can't contain matching rows — this is
        called *filter pushdown*. For example:

            # This query will skip loading partitions with time < '2020-02-01'
            result = ctx.sql('SELECT * FROM air WHERE time > "2020-02-01"').collect()

        Supported operators: `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `AND`, `OR`.

    Args:
        ds: An xarray Dataset. All data_vars must share the same dimensions.
        chunks: Xarray-like chunks specification. If not provided, uses
            the Dataset's existing chunks.
        batch_size: Maximum rows per Arrow RecordBatch emitted per partition.
            Smaller values let DataFusion start processing earlier; the default
            (65 536) works well for most datasets.
        coord_arrays: Pre-materialised coordinate arrays keyed by dim-name
            string.  Hand in to share a single read across multiple tables
            built from the same parent Dataset (e.g. surface + atmosphere
            from ARCO-ERA5); the dim coords are otherwise read once per
            ``read_xarray_table`` call, which is a network round-trip for
            Zarr-backed datasets.
        target_partitions: Upper bound on the number of scan partitions.
            Native chunks are coalesced (consecutive chunks merged, balanced
            across dimensions) so this many partitions or fewer are created,
            keeping registration cost independent of how finely the store is
            chunked. Coarser partitions mean coarser filter-pushdown pruning;
            raise this for more selective pruning, lower it for faster
            registration. Pass ``None`` to disable coalescing entirely (one
            partition per native chunk, the historical behavior).
        _iteration_callback: Internal callback for testing. Called once per
            coalesced partition with that partition's (super-)block dict just
            before it's converted to Arrow.

    Returns:
